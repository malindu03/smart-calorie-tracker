Calorie Tracker App
A smart, AI-powered application designed to make nutrition tracking simple, accurate, and intuitive. This app solves the common problem of logging complex, multi-component meals by leveraging a hybrid AI workflow to analyse food from a single photo.

This project is being built as a full-stack portfolio piece to showcase skills in app/web development, backend engineering, and the orchestration of multiple AI services.

Key Features
The application is being built with the following core features in mind:

Hybrid AI Meal Analysis: Snap a photo of your meal, and our multi-step AI process identifies the dish's components using Google's Gemini Vision API and then retrieves detailed nutritional data for each item from the Spoonacular API.

Interactive Confirmation UI: The AI's suggestions are presented in a user-friendly, editable list, allowing you to confirm, adjust, or remove items to ensure perfect accuracy before logging.

Barcode Scanning: Instantly log packaged foods by scanning their barcode.

Manual Search: A comprehensive search feature to manually find and log any food item from a vast database.

Social Groups & Leaderboards: Create and join groups with friends to stay motivated and compete on weekly leaderboards.

Progress Tracking: Visualize your journey with charts and graphs for weight, calories, and macronutrient intake.
